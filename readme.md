# tyda.py

This is a very simple tool, written in python, that uses the native tyda.se http request to translate between Swedish and English.




## Installation

Clone the repo and run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

After that a translation can be made with:

    ./tyda.py translation

The result would be written in your terminal window:

    translation
    översättning
    tolkning
    återgivning
    transformering
    translation
    omvandling




## Usage tip

Write a simple alias in your .bash_rc, .bash_completion or similar like this:

    alias tyda='/home/you/path/to/tyda.py'

After that you can translate anywhere in your terminal window by typing:

    tyda the_word_you_want_to_translate
